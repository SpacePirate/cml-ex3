# Exercise 3: Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks
In this exercise, you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural
networks to recognize hand-written digits. Before starting the programming
exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing
the review questions for the associated topics.
<br />
To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the starter
code and unzip its contents to the directory where you wish to complete the
exercise. If needed, use the cd command in Octave/MATLAB to change to
this directory before starting this exercise.
<br />
You can also find instructions for installing Octave/MATLAB in the 
Environment Setup Instructions" of the course website.
